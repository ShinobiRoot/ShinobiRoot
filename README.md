# 💀 Silent Hunter | Red Team Operator | Offensive Security Savage

I don’t knock on doors — I *kick* them down.  
I don’t ask for access — I take it.  
I don’t make noise — I leave no trace.

If you want to play, bring your best.  
If you want to survive, don’t get caught.

## 🎯 Mission

> I don’t find bugs — I **hunt vulnerabilities** and **plant footholds**.  
> I don’t leave reports — I leave *open doors* and *back channels*.  
> I don’t stop at the perimeter — I **own the entire network** silently.

Passive reconnaissance only. Loud scans get you blacklisted.  
Stealth and precision are the name of the game.  
This is not a game for amateurs. This is war.
